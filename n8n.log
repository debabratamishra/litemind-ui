Permissions 0644 for n8n settings file /Users/debabratamishra/.n8n/config are too wide. This is ignored for now, but in the future n8n will attempt to change the permissions automatically. To automatically enforce correct permissions now set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true (recommended), or turn this check off set N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=false.
Initializing n8n process
n8n's port 5678 is already in use. Do you have another instance of n8n running already?
